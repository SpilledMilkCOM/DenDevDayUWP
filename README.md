# Denver DEV Day:
### Giving back to the UWP Community Toolkit
The sample app to showcase part of Microsoft's UWP Community Toolkit.
Hopefully the talk will inspire others (think of LEGO Emmet's speech)  to help with the toolkit as well and I don't put everybody to sleep.

Just in case you missed the talk, I've blogged it at the link below:
